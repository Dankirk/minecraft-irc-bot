I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch em is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each pokemon to understand
The power that's inside
Pokemon, it's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon, oh you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
