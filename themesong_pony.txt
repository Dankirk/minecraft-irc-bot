My little pony
I used to wonder what friendship could be
Until you all shared it's magic with me
Big adventure
Tons of fun
A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong
Sharing kindness
It's an easy feat
and magic makes it all complete
You have my little ponies
You know you're all my very best friends
