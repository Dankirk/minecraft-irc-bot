It's always hard,
When the journey begins.
Hard to find your way,
Hard to make new friends.
But there's nothing you can't do,
'Cause you've got the power inside of you
It's not always black and white
But your heart always knows what's right
It's not about win or lose, it's the path you choose.
Let the journey begin, Pokémon
